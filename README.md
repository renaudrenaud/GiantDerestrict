Giant bike derestrict: take away the 25kmh limitation for 10â‚¬ (Arduino inside)


## No more limitation!
In France legal speed with an electric bike is 25km/h.

The Giant e+1 road 2019 is elsewhere sold as 28 miles per hour, it means 45km/h.

So here is a low cost solution to ride the bike on private roads at real speed.

I will provide a schematic and we also working on a 3D design to install the thing easily on the bike.

I also write some documentation here:

and push some videos on youtube:
